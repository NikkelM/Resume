# Resume

Download the latest version of my resume [here](https://github.com/NikkelM/resume/releases/latest/download/mollenhauer_resume.pdf).

You are welcome to use my resume as a template to get your own one started, it is itself a heavily modified version of an existing template, to which I unfortunately did not keep the source link.
