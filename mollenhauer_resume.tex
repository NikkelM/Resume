		\item I am involved in our observability strategy, synthetic and sync/async monitoring, as well as metric emission and configuration.
		\item My work has resulted in a reduction of noisy incidents for our on-call engineers, and improved detection of livesite issues.
		\item Alerting for certain high-impact failure modes has been improved by up to 2 hours of earlier detection, down to minutes.

		\item I provided training to my globally distributed team to gather feedback and ensure the probes offered the desired new insights.
		\item Additionally, I investigated and resolved compatibility issues within the ecosystem following deployment of the new probes.
